      "1349    Hello,I just completed my order for the __COMPANY__ running shoes ( order# __ORDER_NUMBER__). As soon as I put my payment information in, it completed the order before I could enter the cyber Monday promo code. Could you please include the tote bag with my order please. Would it also be possible to include the elastic non tie bands with my shoes please? I ordered shoes from you in the past, and the non tie laces were not included.Thank you very much, __NAME__Cyber Monday Tote gift\n",

I d like to express my disappointment in your advertising claiming free overnight delivery by__DATE__ if ordered by __DATE__ I placed an order on __DATE__ and just received the tracking information indicating a delivery by FedEx on __DATE__. This creates a HUGE inconvenience, as I will now need to buy shoes locally since I was counting on the new ones arriving today (before a trip I ll be making tomorrow). If you decide to advertise that something will be delivered by a particular date, any reasonable person would expect that you stand behind that, as anything else is considered false advertising and quite deceptive/misleading.

      "610    Order Number\\n  __ORDER_NUMBER__\\n \\n\\n Hi, I ordered these shoes (my second__COMPANY_NAME__) on the __DATE__ but I still havent received them. \\n The delivery company DHL is an absolute nighmare. They delivered it at one point to a collection point that wouldnt let my husband collect it (its also not open weekends). Then they kept trying to deliver and wouldnt say when, obvsiously since I have a full time job, im never in when they try to deliver and they dont seem to attempt it at weekends. Their \\n tracking site doesn't seem to give you any say in when the delivery is (unlike Royal Mail). \\n I think my shoes have now gone somewhere else, as they made a final attempt today, and I wasn't here . I really really want my shoes!!\\n \\n\\n Please can you tell them how I can get them please!!\\n \\n\\n __NAME__- __EMAIL__\n",

I had heard from friends that OC's where the best running shoe that they had ever worn. I have to agree, they are the most comfortable shoe I have put on. I have one complaint, my daughter accidently stepped on the back of the sole and it became detached from the shoe body. I tried to glue it back on, but after a could of weeks it detached again. I believe this to be a design flaw due to the fact that the back of the sole sticks out considerably and is easily stepped on or caught. What are my options? Now every time I wear the shoes, the side with the torn sole squeak's... very irritating.. now I cannot wear the shoes and I am hesitant to purchase another pair.. can you help me?\\n \\n\\n thanks\n",

      "818    I recommend _COMPANY_ to all my friends and acquaintances. I feel _COMPANY_ truly stands by their products and the quality has been exceptional for clean beauty.\\n\\nI'm writing to you because I purchased a  _PRODUCT_NAME_, order number _ORDER_NUMBER_ and  _PRODUCT_NAME_ order number _ORDER_NUMBER_.\\n\\nI purchased the foundation considering I was about to run low on the one I already had; and recently opened the foundation on _DATE_since I ran out. The quality of the foundation application was not as smooth compared to my prior purchase. \\nThe concern I have with the  _PRODUCT_NAME_ is that I'm unable to use it comfortably. I thought it needed some time for me to \"break it in\" but that never occurred. As a result, I didn't use it as often because I got tired of breaking it apart with a needle to get the pigment onto the brush. If the products gets returned to your facility, you can see how I had to keep breaking the _PRODUCT_NAME_ and how much i haven't used the  _PRODUCT_NAME_ and the full amount of the foundation in the tube.\\n\\nYou guys have been great in resolving minor problems where I received a wrong product or one of my product had two of the same eyeshadow color.  What is the best solution for these two items?\\n\\nThank you and hope we can find a solution to my concerns.\\n_NAME_\\n\\n\\n\n",

Why was my money wasted? I took the quiz that said I like florals and fruity scents. This is woodsy and spicey which makes me nauseous and I never chose it. Why was this done? I want to be sent something that I would put in my queue if you want me to come back as a customer.  I work hard for my money and I donâ€™t like that you wasted it. Itâ€™s like you just wanted to get rid of that perfume. Many other complaints said the same thing. I want something else. That is the opposite of my preferences and Iâ€™m not settling and just going to accept it. Iâ€™ll send it back on your shipping cost. \\n\\n__EMAIL__\\n\\n\\n_NAME_\n",

I then received email to __EMAIL__ that _DATE_ that my _COMPANY_ is charged _PRICE_for shipment.  I logged into my _COMPANY_ account and checked my queue and site shows that a Fragrance named _PRODUCT_NAME_ has been shipped.  Problem is:  I did not queue this Item, and I just received notification that _PRODUCT_NAME_ has already been shipped to me and charged. I reviewed your return policy and _COMPANY_ does not accept returns on a la carte fragrance vials.  I had queue my _DATE_ choice prior, when I signed up but queue does not show my additional item choice.  Please advise on why _COMPANY_ shipped _PRODUCT_NAME_ and emailed me notification after _COMPANY_ decided their choice for me? And advise on resolution to this issue.   to __EMAIL__ \n",

      "410    Hello! This is my second email... I havent received a response from almost a week ago. Ive also tried calling 10 times and nobody ever picks up the phone and it doesn't let you leave a message. So basically I paid for expedited shipping so it would have arrived prior to tuesday of last week. I was leaving to go out of town wednesday and wanted them for hiking. The package was not delivered on time. I am shipping them back but i would also like the shipping cost refunded. There is not a fed ex label in the box like your directions state so if you could email that to me as well...that would be appreciated. Thank you. Lauren\n",

For example, a pair of __PRODUCT_NAMES__ is RM 599, plus shipping is RM 690+, which is about 20% more expensive than the shoe price.  I am already a happy owner of on __PRODUCT_NAMES__ and would like add another pair of white __PRODUCT_NAMES__ which is not available in local shop.  I really hope we can get cheap shipping option to our country,  thank you.  - chrisyht@gmail.com\n",

I ordered the shoes to replace another pair of __PRODUCT_NAMES__that fell apart as I'm leaving on a trip on , __DATE__. Is there any way to ensure that they are delivered by tomorrow? Thanks.\n",

At any one time I have three pairs of __COMPANY__running shoes in my closet. What is the warranty on your shoes? The left back pad is halfway off (flapping) on the left shoe of my__PRODUCT_NAMES__Mens size 8. I think I bought these online through your site. I buy from __PLACE__, from __PLACE__, and from __PLACE__. My address is __ADDRESS__ I do not have the receipt but didn't see these in my __PLACE__or __PLACE__ history. Do I simply buy a new pair, send these back, get a discount on my new pair, trash these and get a new pair? Thank you. - __EMAIL__\n",

The shoes arrived last __DATE__in a shoe box contained inside a shipping box that was just large enough for the shoe box. The vest was not in the box. I reached out to your customer service email to find out what happened to the vest and received an email on Friday from \"__NAME__\" that he would be in contact with the warehouse to find out what happened and get back to me. I have not heard back from __NAME__and followed up on Monday again and have not heard anything. The full price was charged and there has not been a credit to my account so I am very concerned about what has happened. Please respond as soon as possible.  \\n I do not want to dispute the charge because i really do want the vest but I also do not want to pay $__AMOUNT__ for something I have not received and for which I have no idea what is happening. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.  \\n Thank you. \\n \\n\\n __NAME__\n",

The Tracking Number provided was __TRACKING_NUMBER__. We ordered two pairs of shoes, however, we only received one pair of shoes from the order (__PRODUCT_NAMES__). When I use the tracking number provided, it states that the entire order was delivered. Could you kindly advise a tracking number for the __PRODUCT_NAMES__as it appears they shipped separately? \\n Thank you\n",

I hope that all is well.\\n\\nI wanted to let you know that my Mom was able to return the three boxes after printing the labels. She said it was a simple process. Many thanks to you and your team for the assistance in sorting out the return of the boxes and sending the replacement order to the alternate address.\\n\\nMy friend _NAME_ received the boxes and brought them to me here in _LOCATION_. However, I noticed that there is one item missing. On my original order, I ordered two sets of _COMPANY_  _PRODUCT_NAME_ that come in packs of 10 (Original Order Number: _ORDER_NUMBER_). I have reviewed the shipping confirmation emails from both the ordinal order that was sent to my address in _LOCATION_ and the new order that was sent to _NAME_l in _LOCATION_ and I discovered that order sent to _NAME_ only included one set of  _PRODUCT_NAME_. In other words, I paid for two, but only received one set.\\n\\nCould you look into this for me please and see that the missing set is sent to my address in _LOCATION_?\\n\\nMany thanks,\\n_NAME_\\n\\n\n",

I am a __OTHER_PI__ and I use them everyday for training. Unfortunately, the flywire on one of my shoes snapped the other day. I am pretty bummed because they seemed to be very high quality and well made shoes. I looked into submitting a warranty request however I purchased these shoes from a dealer in __PLACE__ and I no longer reside in __PLACE__  and I do not have my purchasing information. Is there any way my warranty can be honored without the dealer? I have my owner ID number if that helps at all. Thank you!! - __EMAIL__\n",

I just bought a new pair of shoes in late __DATE__, and have been disappointed with the way these have held up. In the back of the shoe, the foam of the shoe has been pulling away from the fabric such that there is a huge hole. I am wondering if you have some sort of warranty, since this damage feels way beyond the scope of normal wear and tear. Thanks so much!\n",

I bought a pair of__PRODUCT_NAMES__ last year on __DATE__ (so less than a year ago) at a running store here in __PLACE__(Runner s World) that carries your shoes. I have loved them - it s the greatest running shoe I have ever owned, hands down. Last week, when I took my shoes off, the sole detached on one of the shoes on the heal side. I looked up your warranty policy which says that you have a year warranty on your shoes. I have run around 300 km in your shoes since I bought them. What would your warranty cover in this case? \\n \\n\\n Thankful for a response. \\n Kind\n",

I wanted to reach out about my shoes -- I have a pair of the __PRODUCTS_NAMES__ that I got about 6 months ago from a local store here in __PLACE__, . I have had them for approximately 6 months, haven't ran in them much (maybe 15-20 times) and noticed that the side fabric by both of my pinky toes has torn open. Is that standard for your shoes to wear out that easily? Is there some sort of warranty or damage gaurantee on the shoes? Or do I need to get in contact with my local store about it?\n",

      "807    Hi,\\n\\nMy name is Trevor Smithwick.  I've been purchasing __COMPANY__ since about 2012 and love them very much.  I work full time for Hyatt Corporation in the valet department.  People are constantly asking me about the shoes and I tell them how great __COMPANY__ are for running.  I've made a few purchases directly with the __COMPANY__ company website online, but mostly through Road Runner Sports USA at least three times a year with the VIP membership.  These are the only shoes I wear and I love promoting them to the general public.  I was wondering if this company could grant me with any sort of apparel e.g. hat, XL shirt's stickers - really anything.  I would be able to provide recent proofs of __COMPANY__ purchases from Road Runner.  Again, this company is great and would love to meet a rep. one of these day's at a local running shop.  \\n\\nIf __COMPANY__ would be able to provide me with any sort of apparel, it would be much appreciated.\\nI will provide you my address for mail @  \\n\\n__NAME__\\n__ADDRESS__\\n\\nAgain, I will still continue promoting this company.

I check the site from time to time and noticed the new __PRODUCT_NAMES__ which has great styling appearance, but seeing that there aren't any reviews on it I am a little hesitant to purchase due to the price point.  I called my local running shoe store here in __PLACE__- (__PRODUCT_NAMES__ to see if they had heard anything and they said it was still to new to the market and they didn't have any in yet.  Would you consider me trialing a pair of these shoes with the promise to do a review online or some other incentive?  Never know until you ask so please don't take offense to this inquiry.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  - Loyal Customer (__NAME__)  - michael.ewing.jr@gmail.com\n",

I am shipping out my return today, and I was wondering about the refund and where it will go. The representative that I bought my products through (_company_) had me send the money for my order to her, and then she bought the product on her card. According to your refund policy, that means my refund will go to her card. I was hoping that you could send it to my Paypal instead? Thanks! my return refund\n",

I was telling a friend about it who also uses your products, and she suggested I send you note.  I didn't return them because when I ordered them it was cool out and didn't use them until the spring..... so I thought it was too late to do so.  I am a fan of your other products, I run in the _PRODUCT_NAME_ for the past year, I have your _PRODUCT_NAME_ in 2 colours that I absolutely love, but the tights are not meant for marathon runners with large calves.....\n",

But I was sent perfumes for women.  I am a guy and have only ordered male or cross scents.  What would possess you to send me these scents?  Please don't say it's automatically generated because how could it possibly go so off course.  I want to return these and be replaced with new scents or refunded.  The scents sent were _PRODUCT_NAME_and _PRODUCT_NAME_.  Please stick to a person's gender or within reason to selection history.\n",

A few days before it was set to arrive at my home (September 3rd,) I received an email saying that my order was actually out of stock. I have since attempted to put in another order and it says the code is no longer valid. \\n\\nI'm in love with those __PRODUCT_NAMES__ shoes and would really enjoy wearing them as I continue to train, but I am curious as to how to proceed. Any assistance is appreciated. Looking forward to hearing back from you. Love your products!\n",

During the order I added my special code __DISCOUNT_CODE__ to get my cool __COMPANY__ Bag with first online order.  Somehow during the check out the code was removed, so when I hit the final purchase, the code was missing and the bag was added to the order.  Is there anyway to still get my cool __COMPANY__ Bag with my order?  I really hope I can get this bag.  I was excited for both the shoes and bag on my Birthday order.\\nThanks for your help.\\n\\n__NAME__\n",

When I have ordered from __COMPANY__ in the past, I usually receive my shipping confirmation within 24 hours. I was just hoping for an updated order status. They are a gift for someone and I am anxious to give them their new pair of shoes.  \\n \\n\\n Thank you - __EMAIL__\n",

When I have ordered from __COMPANY__ in the past, I usually receive my shipping confirmation within 24 hours. I was just hoping for an updated order status. They are a gift for someone and I am anxious to give them their new pair of shoes.  \\n \\n\\n Thank you - __EMAIL__\n",

Already I am noticing that the sole inserts are fraying and even wearing super thin in some areas. The rest of the shoes are holding up well, it's just the sole inserts.\\n I was wondering if this would be considered as part of a warranty claim or if maybe I could just get the inserts replaced?\\n Thanks so much for your time. I love the shoes otherwise!\\n __NAME__\n",

Better than any other I've worn in 40 year! The price was hard to swallow but I committed and love these shoes! However the the rubber shocks in the bottom of the shoe is severed and the seams are coming apart!? I don't run and only do basic activities daily and these shoes are only 8 weeks old! I wanted to invest in another pair, but now am second guessing the purchase due to the quality. Do you have a warranty with purchase? Thanks and happy weekend! - __EMAIL__\n",

Unfortunately, I ordered a half size down on the _PRODUCT_NAME_ from my usual sizing in _PRODUCT_NAME_ and they are still too, too big. I went on a few runs so far, but while I love the _PRODUCT_NAME_ feeling, I can't reconcile the sizing issue. 6pm won't take them back, and I was wondering if the _PRODUCT_NAME_, which I haven't received yet, also run similar in (over)sizing? Also, this is an odd request, but do you have any _PRODUCT_NAME_ Size 10M (a half size smaller than the 10.5 that's too big) that have been returned or have manufacture defects? I would LOVE to have it in the right size and would gladly pay for shipping, I just spend _PRICE_on _PRODUCT_NAME_ shoes, though, and can't afford to shell out for ANOTHER pair and the hassle of having to send mine back, etc, is such that I was hoping there are some returns or such maybe you could send one?\\n\\nBest,\\n_NAME_\\n\\n__EMAIL__\\n_PHONE_\\n\\n_ADDRESS_  - __EMAIL__\n",

I thought I had.\\nAlso, I already wrote in, but I didn't have enough time to choose something (didn't know it was only 12 hours until it was too late), and was sent something I don't like already (I'm sorry!). Now I see that the next email was already telling me I had to decide by the 3rd?! I hope the next perfume hasn't already gone out :( ?!\\nIf it hasn't, I am attempting to choose one or two things for my queue, but this isn't going \"as planned\". I will search on your site for how to return this first one, but hope I won't have to settle for a second one I don't like due so quickly. I thought I'd have at least three weeks to a month before the next one went out, but maybe not....\\nSo sorry for the trouble!\\nSincerely, _NAME_\n",

During my first run in them I felt a bump in the sole hitting the ball of my right foot, and on the front left of the left foot I felt the fabric bending and it was rubbing my foot big toe area. I chalked it up as just them needing to be broken in. The next morning I went for a run and that night the outside lateral muscles on both of my feet were aching and cramping very badly. I took yesterday off and still feel pain. I have never had any foot pain and I've been running for a long time. I am sure it's the shoes which makes me sad. I have many friends that have on clouds and are very happy with them. Any chance this pair could be a rare lemon or something?\n",

I would really like a replacement sent.\n",

I was telling a friend about it who also uses your products, and she suggested I send you note.  I didn't return them because when I ordered them it was cool out and didn't use them until the spring..... so I thought it was too late to do so.  I am a fan of your other products, I run in the _PRODUCT_NAME_ for the past year, I have your _PRODUCT_NAME_ in 2 colours that I absolutely love, but the tights are not meant for marathon runners with large calves.....\n",

      "372    Hello,\\n \\n\\n I received a pair of running shoes for Christmas and had a question about premature wear... The mesh fabric on either side where the shoe flexes in motion has broke free and is fraying. I wasn't sure if this would be considered a warranty item? I am happy to send pictures, just let me know. They have been great shoes but I real feel like they should last for more than 6 months, especially since I only wear them to work and for casual use (no running). I have never owned any running shoes that cost more than $__AMOUNT__and I guess it is only fair to expect more life from a $__AMOUNT__ shoe... \\n \\n\\n I don't mean to complain but trying to give feedback and share my conception of quality : value. Please let me know your thoughts and thanks.\\n \\n\\n __NAME__\n",

I have been a frequent user for The __PRODUCT_NAMES__ model and it s my 1st time trying the __PRODUCT_NAMES__ due to the stability claim. I have ran in the shoe twice and both times the sides of both my toes hurts. I never had this problem with my other __PRODUCT_NAMES__model. After a 10km run today, the side of my toe is giving me blisters. I have thrown the original box away because i didn'tthink I would have this problem. Pls let advice.

The gentlemen in customer service asked if they can intercept delivery and have it delivered to my house instead which really won't help me because I will be out of town.\\n \\n\\n I'm very disappointed that this has happened.

My shoes are scheduled for delivery on the __DATE__. I am a little disappointed as this is the first time I am trying your shoes. I was super excited and expecting to receive them today based on the promotion you were running, order by __DATE__, receive before the __DATE__.. I usually purchase __PRODUCT_NAMES__. If I knew I wasn't going to get them today, I might have re-purchased Hoka's. Sure hope these live up to the hype because my expectations are already not being met. - __EMAIL__\n",

I used to have a _COMPANY_ subscription and my favorite scent was unfortunately mislabeled. I really want to know what the scent is so I can buy a full bottle. I previously had a support ticket open about this under this email, and the representative sent me a return label to send it back to be identified. However, I have been out of the country since then and I am back, and I was wondering if there is still any way I can identify the bottle that was sent to me. Thanks.\n",

My understanding was that if I used this promotion, I could try out my shoes and return them within 30 days if I did not like them.  That would require that I run with them outside.  But the paperwork I got with the shoes says they can be returned but they must be \"as fresh as out of the box\".  That implies that they cannot be \"tried out\" as the Lovett promo indicates.  What is the deal?  Please reply ASAP.\n",

I paid $__AMOUNT__ for accelerated shipping. My understanding was that this would take 2 business days. However, tracking shows that the package is scheduled to arrive on __DATE__ (which is much longer than expected). \\n \\n\\n Can you please clarify whether or not the shipping is in fact expedited for the additional fee?\n",

I was super excited and expecting to receive them today based on the promotion you were running, order by __DATE__, receive before the __DATE__.. I usually purchase __PRODUCT_NAMES__.

I chose the slowest shipping method because it was free, with the understanding that it would take 3-5 business days to arrive. The order was submitted on __DATE__, and I just got notice that it shipped yesterday on __DATE__ and is expected to arrive on __DATE__. I know there was a holiday last week, but it is disappointing to have to wait this long on a new order. If the product is in stock, I would expect it to ship within 2 business days of the order date. Now I am without my running shoes for an extra several days. Had I known it would take this long I would have chosen a different shipping method.\n",

I also bought my wife a couple of pairs too. I initially bought a pair to run in but I love the design and comfort of your shoes so i wear them casually as well. My wife is on her feet all day so I bought her a pair and she loved them so I got her another. I would like to purchase more shoes for my wife and I and was wondering if there were any discounts I should keep an eye out for. I plan on both of us owning about 10 pairs. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Please have a wonderful day. V/r__NAME__\n",

I'm a devoted on cloud runner and have recruited many friends to the brand :) Your shoes helped my IT bands so much and I somehow posted faster times with more weight!! I  ve convinced another friend of mine to look into them and was wondering if you have a discount code for first time buyers that I could send her? Thanks and keep on keeping on! __NAME__\n",

Any help would beappreciated.PS While I have your attention; while searching for my size specificallymany shoes and color combinations appear when maybe only 1 of the 7 coloroptions have my size.

The team members are placed in several countries.Thank you and I am looking forward to hearing from you.Kind \n",

But it comes up as out of stock, and then won't let me delete theitem to move on. When I change the quantity to 0 for that, it just adds itback in. I'd like to order these shoes as I waited on the weekend for mysize to come back in stock and have gone online to order right away. Thanksfor your help. I've attached an image.__NAME__\n",

I cannot see anything on your website about vouchers, is this a product you have?  The voucher cost will be approximately  Â£50 -  Â£100.  I look forward to your earliest response.

My understanding was that if I used this promotion, I could try out my shoes and return them within 30 days if I did not like them.  That would require that I run with them outside.  But the paperwork I got with the shoes says they can be returned but they must be \"as fresh as out of the box\".  That implies that they cannot be \"tried out\" as the Lovett promo indicates.  What is the deal?  Please reply ASAP.\n",

(and my lightheaded partner just found it amongst his tax receipts.) (to be honest, the handwriting on the gift certificate is a little funky... the 7 looks like a 4 and 1 looks like a 7. so let me know if the number doesn't match, and i'll send you an image. thanks again. i really miss the store, and the staff always smiled when i walked past on my hungover mornings to get some milk for my tea. i hope they got happily employed somewhere else at __COMPANY__.\n",

We are heading into or second year and will name approximately 110 brand ambassadors next year.  Including 8 elites and 2 Challenged Athletes.  The past 2 years we've partnered with brands like Roka, Rudy Project and several others in nutrition, etc.  This year we will add Pioneer and Officine Mattio.  I personally love your shoes, and recently wore them, at Kona, in the annual fun UPR.  We would be interested in, and very excited to partner with, your brand encouraging our athletes to try your shoes, if they have not already.  We understand partnerships do not offer free product but discounts definitely encourage others to give a new brand a shot.  We would use your shoes in our upcoming professional shoots as well.  Our IG is @DixieDevilSport if you'd like to check us out. Thank you very much for your time.\\n\\nKindest Regards,\\n\\n__NAME__\n",

I looked at your combo's and I was wondering if there's an option to make a change to the \"__PRODUCT_NAMES__\"? My wife needs a stability shoe so I'd like to get her a __PRODUCT_NAMES__, women's size 10 US (aqua & white is what comes up for Canada but the combo is purple and rose - either of which is fine) but I can't wear a stability shoe so I was hoping to exchange the second pair of __PRODUCT_NAMES__ for the same size in women's __PRODUCT_NAMES__, Flame & Shadow, US (W): 10. \\n\\nWe are a part of Search and Rescue and the reviews look great so I thought the __PRODUCT_NAMES__ would be a great second option as trail runners are typically more rigid soles. \\n\\nPlease let me know if we can make this a reality. \\n\\nThank you again!\\n\\nPS if ever you need a professional sales representative for the Pacific Northwest (US and Canada) I would love to represent your brand!!! I'm an avid outdoors person and stay active between hiking, running (on and off road), mountain biking, and crossfit 3-5 days per week. \\n\\nCheers,\\n\\n__NAME__\n",

This is a once in a life time opportunity, which consist of camping, safari and most importantly helping local villages, doing charitable events which hopefully can help them get through their day to day lives easier.\\n\\nI am needing to raise  Â£3000 to get me to Africa and help those in need, so I am doing a sponsored run next year to try and raise the money. I was just wondering if you would like to sponsor me for this and I will wear your clothing during the run. l will also put your @ on all social media to promote your brand as much as possible as a thank you for sponsoring me. \\n\\nBe nice to hear back from you, thank you\n",

      "567    \\n\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI am very interested in joining your influencer/pro program.\\n\\nThrough my company Adventure Architects, I am dedicated to bringing the heads of companies and their teams into the outdoors to partake in a variety of outdoor activities ranging from SUP'ing, rock climbing, sailing, yoga, outdoor dining, meditation, surfing, heli skiing, snow mobiling, glamping, etc. I built this company to allow me to personally host most of these experiencing while balancing the responsibilities of being a CEO of a fast growing company. We are dedicated to supporting sustainable practices internally and externally (educating our clients on everything from carbon-offsetting, recycling, opting out of one time use plastics, and nurturing a positive appreciation for the environment.\\n\\nIt's also worth drawing attention to the community groups that we service (Summit.co & https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bAPbUG_OmBstmmgY63ELsigAV_DoVceJ/view , thebatterysf.com & WeWork). I believe these could be compelling for you as they create diverse exposure to an affluent user group who opt-in to have premium outdoor experiences and I imagine are well placed to become your customers. The most compelling of the group is probably the summit community for whom I personally host a variety of outdoor/active experiences in Tulum, at Summit Powder Mountain and Los Angeles. Take a look at the deck I linked above.\\n\\nAdditionally, I volunteer as a cadet with Marin Search and Rescue. With approximately sixty active members, Marin County's Search and Rescue (Marin SAR) responds to searches for missing children and adults, evidence and other search requests in the county and on mutual aid calls anywhere in the state of California. Marin SAR is a mountain rescue Type I team with the motto of: \"Anytime, Anywhere, Any Weather.\" We just got back last night after 3 days of searching the Trinity Alps for missing hiker.\\n\\nAs an outdoor professional, I am always on the hunt for apparel and gear that lives at the intersection of functionality and style. I believe your products do just that and it would be an honor to rep your company in front of our audience.  - carina.hessmer@gmail.com\n",

I used to have a _COMPANY_ subscription and my favorite scent was unfortunately mislabeled. I really want to know what the scent is so I can buy a full bottle. I previously had a support ticket open about this under this email, and the representative sent me a return label to send it back to be identified. However, I have been out of the country since then and I am back, and I was wondering if there is still any way I can identify the bottle that was sent to me. Thanks.\n",

When I added them to my cart and paid for them, the size was EU 47. However, when I checked my email, it was reporting a US 12? I didn't think it would be shipped out *that* quickly, so I guess it's too late to fix now (if there is a problem). I live in _LOCATION_and don't want to really deal with the hassle of figuring out how to return stuff here, but is there a way to check to verify what size was shipped to me?\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\n_NAME_ - __EMAIL__\n",

This states that you didnâ€™t withdrawal from My account, so that false. Not to mention false advertising on your end again. Thatâ€™s why I pulled my account before. From being charge _PRICE_ to automatically increase with no alert ... Last, why donâ€™t you have a business number to speak to a representative??Â \\nSorry, I know I sound upset. For this to happen the minute I return is just not fair.Â Please credit My Checking account or inform me on what the procedures will beÂ this month!Â \\nThank you!Â \\n\\nSent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone\n",

However, they have not worked out for me.  My feet and knees are more sore than they have been since I started running 5 years ago.  I haven't been able to run for the past two weeks.  I've been walking in the _PRODUCT_NAME_ shoes I bought and I am still experiencing pain in my feet and knees.  I usually wear _PRODUCT_NAME_ or _PRODUCT_NAME_ for my running shoes and I was confident these would be superior to those brands, but my experience has not been a positive one.  I am outside of the 30 day purchase window.  I save all year to buy a new pair of running shoes each _DATE_ (lowly teachers' salary) and am thoroughly disappointed by the discomfort these shoes have given me.  I prefer to not post negative reviews online because I am sure that for many people they are great.  Is there anything you can do to help me?  I need to be able to keep up my daily running routine but I won't be able to buy another pair of shoes until next summer.  Please help!\n",

My fiance, my sister, and neighbors are receiving COMPANY_ and I do not know why or what is happening but I refuse to just let u guys just keep my money when everyone I get I return except for the only one I should be getting. They are coming in obviously fake made up names so there is definitely a problem and it needs to be resolved w my money being reimbursed. I have never in my life had a company do this to me and I love ur services and products but I am prepared to go to whatever lengths I must if we cannot resolve this between us. You cannot keep telling me the screenshots are showing charges that didnt go through when I keep getting these packages and _COMPANY_reimbursed me for 13 charges already. I am not trying to be difficult, I am trying to be calm, patient, and understanding but these charges are real and I dont have this kind of money to throw around, all these charges were bill money that I now have no idea how im going to manage. PLease take me seriously and help me resolve this and get my money back.\n",
